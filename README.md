This project provides a starting point for a multi-page website including homepage, information pages, and navigation. This project builds off of the [Prismic Community starter][original] for Next & Prismic.

- **Learn more about MUI**: [MUI Documenation][mui-docs]

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

To start a new project using this starter, run the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
npx degit rvdhooft/next-mui-prismic-starter your-project-name
cd your-project-name
npx @slicemachine/init
```

The commands will do the following:

1. Start a new Next.js project using this starter.
2. Ask you to log in to Prismic or [create an account][prismic-sign-up].
3. Create a new Prismic content repository.

Next run the following command to start up slicemachine:

```sh
npm run slicemachine
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:9999`, open the Changes tab, and click the Push Changes button to push the custom content types to Prismic.

Now if you refresh the Prismic content repository, you should be able to add some content. Create at least one page, settings, and navigation.

When your content is created, you're ready to run the project:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Optional configuration

A few environment variables have been set up that you can customize in the .env file:

1. Include a support email to be shown on the user-facing error page. Preview your changes by navigating to /500.
2. Include a LogRocket key to enable [LogRocket][logrocket] for collecting user sessions & errors. Free tier is available.
